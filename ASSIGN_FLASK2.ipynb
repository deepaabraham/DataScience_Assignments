Parameters are visible in the URL, making it easy to bookmark, share, and see the data being sent, an hence sensitive information should not be sent using this method. GET requests can be cached, making them suitable for situations where the same request is likely to be repeated. \n",

This allows for the submission of larger amounts of data compared to the limited space available in the URL. Parameters are not visible in the URL, providing a more secure way to transmit sensitive information and hence POST is commonly used for submitting sensitive information, such as login credentials or data that should not be visible in the URL. POST requests are not cached by default. "
